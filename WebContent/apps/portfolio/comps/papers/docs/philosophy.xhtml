    <h1>Philosophy</h1>
    <p>The most important part in my life is credit. On the other word, it is honesty. To prove my innocent, I had fought against my government for 7 years in the court. My problem was related to military service in Korea. The government office for the military service is the strongest part in South Korea because of North Korea. However, I was the first person who won the government office in Korea, so I needed to waste my 7 years. For all the time, I could not enter any university and have any job, but I had just stood the situation to prove that I am human. It is really difficult to keep honesty because people feel more comfortable to corruption, and the corruption expands like disease. I am witnessing the disease in my school now, but I am just doing my best to keep my philosophy. Honesty will control the corruption to be kicked out from my life at the end. Of course, I will lose lots of things in my life to retain my honesty, but I will choose to keep my honesty every time for humanity. </p>
